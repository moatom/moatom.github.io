  I am a software engineer (mainly writing Scala for my job)
  with strong interest in research on software.

  My research interests focus on theoretical foundations of software and
  the application of them, especially in the following fields:

  - Programming languages
  - (Moderately) Functional programming
  - Code generation, metaprograming
  - Embedded domain-specific languages

  My main research work is about [strymonas](https://strymonas.github.io/)---a
  lightweight declarative stream processing library which proposes *complete stream fusion*;
  its processing runs in constant memory!

## Avoiding Ambiguity

- Typing, verification, etc., are outside the scope of my **research** interests.
  I am just an ordinary user of them.
  - From the perspective of [the lazy programmers](https://thethreevirtues.com/), I prefer GC over handling ownership for example. 🤫
- Kobayashi is a common last name in Japan and no relative of mine isn't in research fields;
  certainly my father was, but in the area of medicine---[artificial heart](https://nrid.nii.ac.jp/en/nrid/1000020323610/),
  and not in computer science, mathematics, etc. :-)

[^1]: If you are a foreigner, please note that GPAs at Japanese universities are assigned with extreme rigor. As far as I know, my grades have remained among the top scores in my course. (FIXME: This is not the final record, but it should be close to it.)
[^2]: The same as 1. As evidence of this, I was exempted from the written exam when I entered the graduate school.
