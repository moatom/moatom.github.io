abstract = {Strymonas is a code-generation--based library (embedded DSL) for fast,  
bulk, single-thread in-memory stream processing -- with the declarative  
description of stream pipelines and yet achieving the speed and memory  
efficiency of hand-written state machines. It guarantees complete  
stream fusion in all cases.  

So far, strymonas has been used on small examples and  
micro-benchmarks. In this work, we evaluate strymonas on a large,  
real-life application of Software-Defined Radio -- FM Radio  
reception, -- contrasting and benchmarking it against the synchronous  
dataflow system StreamIt, and the state-of-the art: GNU Radio.  

Strymonas, despite being declarative, single-thread single-core with  
no explicit support for SIMD, no built-in windowing or convolution,  
turns out to offer portable high performance, well enough for  
real-time FM Radio reception. It is on par with (or, on Raspberry Pi  
Zero, outstripping) GNU Radio, while providing static guarantees of  
complete fusion and type safety.},
