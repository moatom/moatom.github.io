  abstract =     "Strymonas is a code-generation--based library
                 (embedded DSL) for fast, bulk, single-thread in-memory
                 stream processing -- with the declarative description
                 of stream pipelines and yet achieving the speed and
                 memory efficiency of hand-written state machines. It
                 guarantees complete stream fusion in all cases. So far,
                 strymonas has been used on small examples and
                 micro-benchmarks. In this work, we evaluate strymonas
                 on a large, real-life application of Software-Defined
                 Radio -- FM Radio reception, -- contrasting and
                 benchmarking it against the synchronous dataflow system
                 StreamIt, and the state-of-the art: GNU Radio.
                 Strymonas, despite being declarative, single-thread
                 single-core with no explicit support for SIMD, no
                 built-in windowing or convolution, turns out to offer
                 portable high performance, well enough for real-time FM
                 Radio reception. It is on par with (or, on Raspberry Pi
                 Zero, outstripping) GNU Radio, while providing static
                 guarantees of complete fusion and type safety.",
